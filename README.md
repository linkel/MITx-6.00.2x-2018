# MITx-6.00.2x-2018

I took the online edX course [MITx 6.00.2x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.2x+3T2018a/course/) ending Dec 19, 2018. It was a fun course! Uses Python, teaches a little bit of rudimentary statistics, probability, and touches lightly on machine learning concepts. 

This repository is a collection of the problem sets, notes, quiz, and final from MITx-6.00.2x on edX, taken in 2018. 

Haven't yet uploaded some of the psets because they are too messy for the world's eyes.
